# DataStructuresFromScratch
A collection of implementations of fundamental data structures coded from scratch in Python, Java, Haskell, Rust, and C++. This repository serves as a hands-on approach to reinforce my understanding of data structures and to sharpen my coding skills across multiple programming languages.

### Linear Data Structures
These data structures organize their elements in a linear sequence. Each element is connected to its previous and next element.

|----------------|:------:|:----:|:-------:|:----:|:---:|
| Array          |   ❌    |  ❌   |    ❌    |  ❌   |  ❌  |
| Linked List    |   ❌    |  ❌   |    ❌    |  ❌   |  ❌  |
| Stack          |   ❌    |  ❌   |    ❌    |  ❌   |  ❌  |
| Queue          |   ❌    |  ❌   |    ❌    |  ❌   |  ❌  |
| Deque          |   ❌    |  ❌   |    ❌    |  ❌   |  ❌  |
